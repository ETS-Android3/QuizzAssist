## Process

An application that will assist instructors in moderating in-class participation events, including quizzes and examinations. Instructors can create a group for their class, other users will be able to join via invite link, and instructors will be able to create events during the current hosting session, giving students access to a whiteboard to draw on. These events can vary in purpose, such as in-class activities for students to demonstrate their knowledge (draw a linked list, demonstrate what happens when arr[index] is out of bounds, etc.) for a given question, which students can then submit, allowing the instructor to gauge how proficient the class may be for a certain topic. When the app is used to moderate a quiz/exam, a time limit can be displayed (instructorâ€™s discretion). Students may write their answers in their provided space (whiteboard; autosaving after each change) and can submit at their discretion, or until the time limit is reached. At the end of the quizz/exam, students will be prompted to take a photo of themselves for identification purposes (app will keep the camera active for the duration of the quiz/exam to discourage academic dishonesty). This solves the problem of students being penalized for failing to submit within the given time period (resulting in a score of 0), or due to technical difficulties (submits the last autosaved work), neither of which are issues when quizzes/exams are hosted in-person.
